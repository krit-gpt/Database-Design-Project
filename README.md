The project was a part of the course CSCE 608 under Dr. Chen. The project was primarily a Database Design project, with the UI playing a very little part - only giving the user the basic CRUD functionality.

The project is trying to store data generated on Facebook (particularly related to the pictures) in an Instagram-inspired database, so that operations can be performed on it. 

I have added the web scraping script along with the detailed report, attached in the repository.
I have provided the Source code and the project report. 

There was some code that I inserted from MySQL workbench, for example, making the database schema. 
I have provided that code in the report.

The URL of the project is: https://infinite-hamlet-44584.herokuapp.com/ Ùè∞Ä 

Tools/Frameworks/Languages used are:
- Node.js
- Express
- MySQL Database
- Heroku with a ClearDB add-on
- MySQLWorkbench
- Python for web scraping data (script attached in the project report)

Additional libraries: Faker, urllib2,  json (python library for reading data)

**Some sample screen shots of the project are:**
